      I am interested in building own cloud, that could be hosted on own hardware.
      Aka everyone-loved automated deploys, ideally with 0 downtime.
      As well as optimize and squeeze performance from their own hardware.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, the current setup of my homelab uses NixOS with systemd services instead
      of Docker containers or virtual machines.
      Because isolation is mostly a requirement of the cloud, as they need to serve many people,
      but if you own your hardware or VPS, then there is no one except you anyway.

    <p>
      List of services' links that run on my home cloud. They are only available
      when I am awake and turn that old laptop on. Because I currently can't run
      homelab fulltime, but plan to soon with electricity shutdowns prevention
      (run electricity through batteries).

    <h3 id="old-laptop-to-server">Old laptop to server</h3>
    <p>
      I got an old laptop for free and using it as a home lab. So as a web developer the first thing I want to figure
      out is how to use own hardware to host servers.

      I created a `deploy-tool` repository where I keep files for tests of deploying websites.
      I decided to try with Nix Shell instead of Docker, so I get to squeeze more resources out of computer.

      But here is overall steps to do it (at the current limit of my knowledge):
      - build web application
      - install dependencies on server (done with Nix Shell in my case, can be done with Docker or just apt)
      - run application on local network, not only single machine (aka 0.0.0.0 or explicitly local ip, like
      192.168.31.10)
      - now you can access your website inside of local network
      - go to your router and forward router's port 80 for TCP to the ip of your server and port that app is running on
      - your probably want to forward port 443 for HTTPS
      - now you should access your website with public IP address, [check whatismyip.com](https://www.whatismyip.com/)
      to
      find out.

      That's what I currently was able to achieve.
      Next steps will be setting up a reverse proxy, so I can host more than 1 public website on single IP.

      As well reverse proxy like [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com) can handle SSL certificates for my.

      Potentially you can buy several static IPs and point each one for each application instead of using reverse proxy.
      It's not a bad idea, especially if your internet provider gives you quite cheap IPs (mine is 1$ for IP in
      Ukraine).

      After I will be able to use existing tools I plan to create own tool to make it all more simpler/automated than
      it's currently is.
      Maybe even competitor to [Coolify](https://coolify.io) and [Kamal](https://kamal-deploy.org). We will see.

    <h3 id="progressive-enhancement">Progressive enhancement</h3>
    <p>
      Progressive enhancement is mostly when users <b>without</b> JavaScript
      can get a <b>good</b> experience, and <b>with</b> JavaScript,
      <b>even better</b> one. It can also be applied to some modern CSS
      features.
    </p>
    <p>
      It allows for reaching more people, because JavaScript can be
      unavailable. Here is a good article about it:
      <a href="https://piccalil.li/blog/a-handful-of-reasons-javascript-wont-be-available">A handful of reasons
        JavaScript won't be available</a>
      by Piccalilli.
    </p>
    <p>
      To develop Progressive enhancement websites, you want to start by
      implementing the main functionality without JavaScript. The website
      should be working fine without it. After this gets done, you can use
      JavaScript to add additional helpers and so on. HTMX style (when you
      return partial HTML from the server) can come in very handy as you will
      be able to remove additional logic from your JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>
      Progressive enhancement will not only make your website accessible to
      more people, but it will also make it simpler. You will not blow up your
      client with a ton of JavaScript because you will value your time spent
      developing it. Reducing complexity can be called a side effect of
      Progressive enhancement. As well, it will force your designer to not
      create some stupid, unrealistic and pixel-perfect design.

    <h3 id="how-to-ssh">How to SSH</h3>
    <p>
      Eventually you will need to SSH at least a little bit. So here is simple
      guides for 2 most popular situations.
    </p>
    <p>For Git:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Generate SSH keys for your local machine (with some cli based on OS)
      </li>
      <li>
        Add public key to your git service (GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, etc.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Clone project with SSH url or change url of existing local repo to SSH
        one
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>For connecting to remote server:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Install OpenSSH or alternative on the server (probably preinstalled)
      </li>
      <li>Obtain IP address of the server</li>
      <li>Run <kbd>ssh {username}@{id}</kbd> from your machine</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      That's it, steps are easily searchable on the internet to get commands.
